# ðŸŽ“ Academic Course Recommender System Using Machine Learning

> A personalized recommender system for Master's students in Information Technology and Business Analytics, designed to suggest the most suitable courses based on academic profiles, interests, and career goals.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge faced by Master's students in selecting courses aligned with their goals. Built in two phases â€” binary classification and content-based recommendation â€” the system predicts course suitability across five courses and delivers ranked, interpretable recommendations based on a student's profile.

## Problem Statement

Many graduate students struggle with course selection due to lack of structured guidance. This project aims to:
- Predict if a course is suitable for a student using binary classification.
- Recommend top-fit courses based on predicted suitability and CareerTrack alignment.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Custom survey via Google Forms
- **Total records**: 55
- **Features collected**:
  - Career Track (e.g., Data Science/AI, Cybersecurity)
  - Preferred Learning Style
  - Study Hours
  - Interest Levels per course (1â€“5)
  - Reason for choosing the course
  - Semester
  - Course Suitability (target: Yes/No for each course)

## Methodology

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Binary Classification

- **Goal**: Predict course suitability (Yes/No)
- **Models used**:  
  - âœ… Logistic Regression *(F1 = 0.900)*  
  - Random Forest  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Logistic Regression with Polynomial Features  
  - Logistic Regression with PCA-based feature reduction

- **Techniques**:
  - Class imbalance handling with `class_weight=balanced`
  - OneHotEncoding for categorical variables
  - Imputation using mean/mode
  - K-Fold Cross-Validation
  - Learning curve analysis for overfitting detection

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Content-Based Recommendation

- **Goal**: Recommend courses based on CareerTrack and predicted suitability
- **Approach**:
  - Rank courses by suitability probability from Phase 1
  - Boost probabilities if student's track matches course's ideal profile
  - Penalize over-represented courses (e.g., ADML)
  - Visualize career track alignment per course

---

## A/B Hypothesis Testing

- **Goal**: Validate whether probability-adjusted ranking improves recommendation quality
- **Method**: 
  - Group A received baseline suitability ranking  
  - Group B received adjusted probability ranking  
  - Conducted Chi-square tests (p < 0.05) showing statistically significant improvement in alignment with career aspirations in Group B

---

## Key Results

- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression
  - F1-score: **0.900**
  - Precision: 0.818
  - Recall: 1.000

- **Top Recommendation Example** (CareerTrack: Data Science / AI):
  - PCM (Suitability: 0.809)
  - BI (Suitability: 0.796)
  - BDCN (Suitability: 0.750)

- **Visualization**:
  - Course-to-career alignment heatmaps
  - Top-5 course distributions based on learning style and career goals
